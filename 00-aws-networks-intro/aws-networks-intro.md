## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

I'm learning about cloud networking because I want to become Cloud Engineer and networking is most important part of Cloud.

Cloud networking is like creating a shared postal system that everyone could use:

Let AWS worry about purchasing the physical network hardware and setting up data centers
Pay only for the data transfer you actually use, not for idle equipment
Have cloud network engineers that can focus more on connecting your resources, and less on maintaining any physical infrastructure

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 4–6 focused hours every week to work on this networking series, completing at least 2 projects per week so I can finish all 9 projects within 4–5 weeks.

I will keep myself accountable by tracking completed projects in a simple checklist, taking short notes/screenshots for each lab, and posting weekly progress on LinkedIn or noting it in my CV learning log.

My reward is allowing myself one guilt-free treat each week ( gaming session, or favorite food) and, after completing all projects, updating my CV and LinkedIn with “Hands-on AWS VPC & Networking Projects” and applying confidently to cloud-related roles.

### What are networks?

A computer network is a collection of devices that can exchange data packets. These data packets travel between devices using IP addresses as destinations. As the packets move through the network, they create network traffic.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private section of the AWS network, where you control the flow of network traffic in and out of the AWS resources inside.
 
This helps organizations by carefully designing their VPC because it determines:
Who can access their applications.
How secure their customer data will be.
How their different services communicate with each other.
Whether their applications can connect to the internet.
How traffic flows between different parts of their system.
